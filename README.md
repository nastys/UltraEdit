# UltraEdit
Edit converter for 初音ミク: Project DIVA

## Features:
- Offline edit importer for Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Dreamy Theater 1st/2nd/Extend that does not require a PSP and works with RPCS3

## Requirements
- 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04 or Linux Mint 20, or 64-bit Windows 7
- OpenGL 3.0 GPU (or software renderer)

## Known issues
- The program may crash after setting up the directories for the first time. In this case, just restart it

## Limitations
- Encrypted PS3 save data and edits are not supported yet. However, encrypted PSP edits are fully supported
- While you can import PSP 2nd edits into DT Extend (and vice versa), the program will not perform any conversion (it is recommended to import PSP 2nd edits into PSP Extend first)
